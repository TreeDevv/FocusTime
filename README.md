# FocusTime

This project was written as a introductory for myself to dive into react with a project based approach

The idea came as a tool for my own use. Focusing during coding time and thats what I ran with
for my first react project idea. While building the project I actually used the timer within.

While not hosted you are welcome to download the project and run it yourself. This while only 
be on my github as long as I dont have any bigger projects up.
